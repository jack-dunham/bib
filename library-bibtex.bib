  abstract  = {The competition between interactions and dissipative processes in a quantum many-body system can drive phase transitions of different order. Exploiting a combination of cluster methods and quantum trajectories, we show how the systematic inclusion of (classical and quantum) nonlocal correlations at increasing distances is crucial to determine the structure of the phase diagram, as well as the nature of the transitions in strongly interacting spin systems. In practice, we focus on the paradigmatic dissipative quantum Ising model: In contrast to the nondissipative case, its phase diagram is still a matter of debate in the literature. When dissipation acts along the interaction direction, we predict important quantitative modifications of the position of the first-order transition boundary. In the case of incoherent relaxation in the field direction, our approach confirms the presence of a second-order transition, while does not support the possible existence of multicritical points. Potentially, these results can be tested in up-to-date quantum simulators of Rydberg atoms.},

  abstract   = {An infinite projected entangled pair state (iPEPS) is a tensor network ansatz to represent a quantum state on an infinite 2D lattice whose accuracy is controlled by the bond dimension D. Its real, Lindbladian, or imaginary time evolution can be split into small time steps. Every time step generates a new iPEPS with an enlarged bond dimension D′{\textgreater}D, which is approximated by an iPEPS with the original D. In P. Czarnik and J. Dziarmaga, Phys. Rev. B 98, 045110 (2018), an algorithm was introduced to optimize the approximate iPEPS by maximizing directly its fidelity to the one with the enlarged bond dimension D′. In this paper, we implement a more efficient optimization employing a local estimator of the fidelity. For imaginary time evolution of a thermal state's purification, we also consider using unitary disentangling gates acting on ancillas to reduce the required D. We test the algorithm simulating Lindbladian evolution and unitary evolution after a sudden quench of transverse field hx in the 2D quantum Ising model. Furthermore, we simulate thermal states of this model and estimate the critical temperature with good accuracy: 0.1\% for hx=2.5 and 0.5\% for the more challenging case of hx=2.9 close to the quantum critical point at hx=3.04438(2).},

  abstract      = {We give in this lecture an introduction to the physics of two-dimensional (2d) Bose gases. We first discuss the properties of uniform, infinite 2d Bose fluids at non-zero temperature T. We explain why thermal fluctuations are strong enough to destroy the fully ordered state associated with Bose-Einstein condensation, but are not strong enough to suppress superfluidity in an interacting system at low T. We present the basics of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless theory, which provides the general framework for understanding 2d superfluidity. We then turn to experimentally relevant finite-size systems, in which the presence of residual ``quasi--long-range''order at low temperatures leads to an interesting interplay between superfluidity and condensation. Finally we summarize the recent progress in theoretical understanding and experimental investigation of ultracold atomic gases confined to a quasi-2d geometry.},

In the presence of effective photon-photon interactions induced by the optical nonlinearity of the medium, a many-photon system can behave collectively as a quantum fluid with a number of novel features stemming from its intrinsically nonequilibrium nature. A rich variety of recently observed photon hydrodynamical effects is presented, from the superfluid flow around a defect at low speeds, to the appearance of a Mach-Cherenkov cone in a supersonic flow, to the hydrodynamic formation of topological excitations such as quantized vortices and dark solitons at the surface of large impenetrable obstacles. While the review is mostly focused on a specific class of semiconductor systems that have been extensively studied in recent years (planar semiconductor microcavities in the strong light-matter coupling regime having cavity polaritons as elementary excitations), the very concept of quantum fluids of light applies to a broad spectrum of systems, ranging from bulk nonlinear crystals, to atomic clouds embedded in optical fibers and cavities, to photonic crystal cavities, to superconducting quantum circuits based on Josephson junctions. The conclusive part of the article is devoted to a review of the future perspectives in the direction of strongly correlated photon gases and of artificial gauge fields for photons. In particular, several mechanisms to obtain efficient photon blockade are presented, together with their application to the generation of novel quantum phases.},

Here, we demonstrate a system of optically guided, electrically polarized exciton-polaritons (``dipolaritons'') that displays up to 200-fold enhancement of the polariton-polariton interaction strength compared to unpolarized polaritons. The magnitude of the dipolar interaction enhancement can be turned on and off and can be easily tuned over a very wide range by varying the applied polarizing electric field. The large interaction strengths and the very long propagation distances of these fully guided dipolaritons open up new opportunities for realizing complex quantum circuitry and quantum simulators, as well as topological states based on exciton-polaritons, for which the interactions between polaritons need to be large and spatially or temporally controlled. The results also raise fundamental questions on the origin of these large enhancements.},

  abstract      = {In recent years, novel two-dimensional materials such as graphene, bismuthene, and transition-metal dichalcogenides have attracted considerable interest due to their unique physical properties. However, certain lattice geometries, such as the Lieb lattice, do not exist as atomic monolayers. Fortunately, a range of physical effects can be transferred to the realms of photonics by creating artificial photonic lattices emulating these two-dimensional materials. Here, exciton-polaritons in semiconductor microcavities offer an exciting opportunity to study a part-light, part-matter quantum fluid of light in a complex lattice potential. In this Rapid Communication, we study exciton-polaritons in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice of buried optical traps. The S and Pxy photonic orbitals of such a Lieb lattice give rise to the formation of two flatbands which are of greatest interest for the distortion-free storage of compact localized states. By using a well controlled etch-and-overgrowth technique, we manage to control the trapping as well as the site couplings with great precision. This allows us to spectroscopically monitor the flatness of the flatbands across the full Brillouin zone. Furthermore, we demonstrate experimentally that these flatbands can be directly populated by condensation under nonresonant laser excitation. Finally, using this advanced device approach we demonstrate resonant and deterministic excitation of flatband modes in transmission geometry. Our findings establish the exciton-polariton systems as a highly controllable, optical many-body system to study flatband effects and for distortion-free storage of compact localized states.},

  abstract      = {We perform a phase-space analysis of strong-field enhanced ionisation in molecules, with emphasis on quantum-interference effects. Using Wigner quasi-probability distributions and the quantum Liouville equation, we show that the momentum gates reported in a previous publication (Takemoto and Becker 2011 Phys. Rev. A 84 023401) may occur for static driving fields, and even for no external field at all. Their primary cause is an interference-induced bridging mechanism that occurs if both wells in the molecule are populated. In the phase-space regions for which quantum bridges occur, the Wigner functions perform a clockwise rotation whose period is intrinsic to the molecule. This evolution is essentially non-classical and non-adiabatic, as it does not follow equienergy curves or field gradients. Quasi-probability transfer via quantum bridges is favoured if the electron's initial state is either spatially delocalised, or situated at the upfield molecular well. Enhanced ionisation results from the interplay of this cyclic motion, adiabatic tunnel ionisation and population trapping. Optimal conditions require minimising population trapping and using the bridging mechanism to feed into ionisation pathways along the field gradient.},

  abstract      = {We propose an analytical approach for computing the eigenspectrum and corresponding eigenstates of a hyperbolic double well potential of arbitrary height or width, which goes beyond the usual techniques applied to quasi-exactly solvable models. We map the time-independent Schr\"odinger equation onto the Heun confluent differential equation, which is solved by using an infinite power series. The coefficients of this series are polynomials in the quantisation parameter, whose roots correspond to the system's eigenenergies. This leads to a quantisation condition that allows us to determine a whole spectrum, instead of individual eigenenergies. This method is then employed to perform an in depth analysis of electronic wave-packet dynamics, with emphasis on intra-well tunneling and the interference-induced quantum bridges reported in a previous publication [H. Chomet et al, New J. Phys. 21, 123004 (2019)]. Considering initial wave packets of different widths and peak locations, we compute autocorrelation functions and Wigner quasiprobability distributions. Our results exhibit an excellent agreement with numerical computations, and allow us to disentangle the different eigenfrequencies that govern the phase-space dynamics.},

  abstract      = {Nonperturbative coupling between cavity photons and excitons leads to the formation of hybrid light-matter excitations, termed polaritons. In structures where photon absorption leads to the creation of excitons with aligned permanent dipoles, the elementary excitations, termed dipolar polaritons, are expected to exhibit enhanced interactions. Here, we report a substantial increase in interaction strength between dipolar polaritons as the size of the dipole is increased by tuning the applied gate voltage. To this end, we use coupled quantum well structures embedded inside a microcavity where coherent electron tunneling between the wells creates the excitonic dipole. Modifications of the interaction strength are characterized by measuring the changes in the reflected light intensity when polaritons are driven with a resonant laser. The factor of 6.5 increase in the interaction-strength-to-linewidth ratio that we obtain indicates that dipolar polaritons could constitute an important step towards a demonstration of the polariton blockade effect, and thereby to form the building blocks of many-body states of light.},

In particular, the theory of matrix Lie groups and their Lie algebras is developed using only linear algebra, and more motivation and intuition for proofs is provided than in most classic texts on the subject.In addition to its accessible treatment of the basic theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras, the book is also noteworthy for including:a treatment of the Baker--Campbell--Hausdorff formula and its use in place of the Frobenius theorem to establish deeper results about the relationship between Lie groups and Lie algebrasmotivation for the machinery of roots, weights and the Weyl group via a concrete and detailed exposition of the representation theory of sl(3;C)an unconventional definition of semisimplicity that allows for a rapid development of the structure theory of semisimple Lie algebrasa self-contained construction of the representations of compact groups, independent of Lie-algebraic argumentsThe second edition of Lie Groups, Lie Algebras, and Representations contains many substantial improvements and additions, among them: an entirely new part devoted to the structure and representation theory of compact Lie groups; a complete derivation of the main properties of root systems; the construction of finite-dimensional representations of semisimple Lie algebras has been elaborated; a treatment of universal enveloping algebras, including a proof of the Poincar{\'e}--Birkhoff--Witt theorem and the existence of Verma modules; complete proofs of the Weyl character formula, the Weyl dimension formula and the Kostant multiplicity formula.Review of the first edition:This is an excellent book. It deserves to, and undoubtedly will, become the standard text for early graduate courses in Lie group theory ... an important addition to the textbook literature ... it is highly recommended.--- The Mathematical Gazette},

In the first part, it concisely presents the basic concepts of Lie algebras, their representations and their invariants. The second part includes a description of how Lie algebras are used in practice in the treatment of bosonic and fermionic systems. Physical applications considered include rotations and vibrations of molecules (vibron model), collective modes in nuclei (interacting boson model), the atomic shell model, the nuclear shell model, and the quark model of hadrons. One of the key concepts in the application of Lie algebraic methods in physics, that of spectrum generating algebras and their associated dynamic symmetries, is also discussed. The book highlights a number of examples that help to illustrate the abstract algebraic definitions and includes a summary of many formulas of practical interest, such as the eigenvalues of Casimir operators, and the dimensions of the representations of all classical Lie algebras.For this new edition, the text has been carefully revised and expanded; in particular, a new chapter has been added on the deformation and contraction of Lie algebras.From the reviews of the first edition:"Iachello has written a pedagogical and straightforward presentation of Lie algebras [...].

  abstract      = {Lie groups and Lie algebras have become essential to many parts of mathematics and theoretical physics, with Lie algebras a central object of interest in their own right. Based on a lecture course given to fourth-year undergraduates, this book provides an elementary introduction to Lie algebras. It starts with basic concepts. A section on low-dimensional Lie algebras provides readers with experience of some useful examples. This is followed by a discussion of solvable Lie algebras and a strategy towards a classification of finite-dimensional complex Lie algebras. The next chapters cover Engel's theorem, Lie's theorem and Cartan's criteria and introduce some representation theory. The root-space decomposition of a semisimple Lie algebra is discussed, and the classical Lie algebras studied in detail. The authors also classify root systems, and give an outline of Serre's construction of complex semisimple Lie algebras. An overview of further directions then concludes the book and shows the high degree to which Lie algebras influence present-day mathematics. The only prerequisite is some linear algebra and an appendix summarizes the main facts that are needed. The treatment is kept as simple as possible with no attempt at full generality. Numerous worked examples and exercises are provided to test understanding, along with more demanding problems, several of which have solutions. Introduction to Lie Algebras covers the core material required for almost all other work in Lie theory and provides a self-study guide suitable for undergraduate students in their final year and graduate students and researchers in mathematics and theoretical physics.},

In a recent work (Chen et al. in Phys Rev Lett 120:030403, 2018), the authors concluded that the dynamics of an open system could be simulated by a Hamiltonian ensemble because of nature of the disorder average. We investigate our algorithm to simulating incoherent dynamics (decoherence) of open system using an efficient variational quantum circuit in the form of master equations. Despite the non-unitary evolution of open systems, our method is applicable to a wide range of problems for incoherent dynamics with the unitary quantum operation.},

In this work we propose and demonstrate a general quantum algorithm to evolve open quantum dynamics on quantum computing devices. The Kraus operators governing the time evolution can be converted into unitary matrices with minimal dilation guaranteed by the Sz.-Nagy theorem. This allows the evolution of the initial state through unitary quantum gates, while using significantly less resource than required by the conventional Stinespring dilation. We demonstrate the algorithm on an amplitude damping channel using the IBM Qiskit quantum simulator and the IBM Q 5 Tenerife quantum device. The proposed algorithm does not require particular models of dynamics or decomposition of the quantum channel, and thus can be easily generalized to other open quantum dynamical models.},

By simulating the thermalization process at zero temperature, we can solve the ground-state problem of quantum systems. To realize the open-system evolution on the quantum computer, we need to encode the environment using qubits. However, usually the environment is much larger than the system, i.e., numerous qubits are required if the environment is directly encoded. In this paper, we propose a way to simulate open-system dynamics by reproducing reservoir correlation functions using a minimized Hilbert space. In this way, we only need a small number of qubits to represent the environment. To simulate the nth-order expansion of the time-convolutionless master equation by reproducing up to n-time correlation functions, the number of qubits representing the environment is similar to(sic)n/2(sic) log(2)(N omega N beta). Here, N-omega is the number of frequencies in the discretized environment spectrum, and N-beta is the number of terms in the system-environment interaction. By reproducing two-time correlation functions, i.e., taking n = 2, we can simulate the Markovian quantum master equation. In our algorithm, the environment on the quantum computer could be even smaller than the system.},

  abstract      = {Phys. Rev. A, 83, 062317 (2011) In the study of open quantum systems, one typically obtains the decoherene dynamics by solving a master equation. The master equation is derived using knowledge of some basic properties of the system, the environment and their interaction: one basically needs to know the operators through which the system couples to the environment and the spectral density of the environment. For a large system, it could become prohibitively difficult to even write down the appropriate master equation, let alone solve it on a classical computer. In this paper, we present a quantum algorithm for simulating the dynamics of an open quantum system. On a quantum computer, the environment can be simulated using ancilla qubits with properly chosen single-qubit frequencies and with properly designed coupling to the system qubits. The parameters used in the simulation are easily derived from the parameters of the system+environment Hamiltonian. The algorithm is designed to simulate Markovian dynamics, but it can also be used to simulate non-Markovian dynamics provided that this dynamics can be obtained by embedding the system of interest into a larger system that obeys Markovian dynamics. We estimate the resource requirements for the algorithm. In particular, we show that for sufficiently slow decoherence a single ancilla qubit could be sufficient to represent the entire environment, in principle.},

  abstract      = {Because of inevitable coupling with the environment, nearly all practical quantum systems are open system, where the evolution is not necessarily unitary. In this paper, we propose a duality quantum algorithm for simulating Hamiltonian evolution of an open quantum system. In contrast to unitary evolution in a usual quantum computer, the evolution operator in a duality quantum computer is a linear combination of unitary operators. In this duality quantum algorithm, the time evolution of the open quantum system is realized by using Kraus operators which is naturally implemented in duality quantum computer. This duality quantum algorithm has two distinct advantages compared to existing quantum simulation algorithms with unitary evolution operations. Firstly, the query complexity of the algorithm is O(d3) in contrast to O(d4) in existing unitary simulation algorithm, where d is the dimension of the open quantum system. Secondly, By using a truncated Taylor series of the evolution operators, this duality quantum algorithm provides an exponential improvement in precision compared with previous unitary simulation algorithm.},

  abstract      = {Simulating the dynamics and the non-equilibrium steady state of an open quantum systems are hard computational tasks on conventional computers. For the simulation of the time evolution, several efficient quantum algorithms have recently been developed. However, computing the non-equilibrium steady state as the long-time limit of the system dynamics is often not a viable solution, because of exceedingly long relaxation times or strong quantum correlations in the transient states. Here, we develop an efficient quantum algorithm for the direct calculation of the non-equilibrium steady state on a fault-tolerant quantum computer. The algorithm makes use of quantum phase estimation to evaluate the eigenvector associated to the zero eigenvalue of the generator of the system dynamics. We show that the output state of the algorithm allows to estimate expectation values of observables on the steady state, using existing methods for the quantum measurement of observables. Away from critical points, where the Liouvillian gap scales as a power law of the system size, the quantum algorithm performs with exponential advantage compared to exact diagonalization.},

  abstract      = {Quantum algorithms can be generally represented as the dynamical evolution of an input quantum register, with the action of each logical gate, as well as of any transmission channel, defined by some quantum propagator. From a global viewpoint, this unitary dynamics is ruled by the flow of a continuous time, and the possible splitting into shorter logical sub-units is nothing but a harmless, though useful, zooming process. On the other hand, understanding how elementary units of the quantum register, namely single qubits, are actually hauled along the algorithm, is a more complex matter, as it involves the dynamical entanglement generation entailed in the action of two-qubit gates. In this work, we first review how the essential elements of quantum algorithms can be described in terms of dynamical processes, and then analyze the corresponding non-unitary dynamics of single qubits, by referring to the formalism adopted in the study of open quantum systems. We show that single qubits evolution cannot be split into intervals shorter than the typical time needed by two-qubit gates for accomplishing their task, which somehow gives a rhythmical structure to the algorithm itself. We further point out that the local evolution entails a memory, in that the way each qubit takes an infinitesimally small step forward in time, is set by its previous history, back to the instant when it entered the last two-qubit gate. This memory originates from quantum correlations, and it is suggested to play an essential role in quantum information processing. As a concluding remark, we just touch on the idea that a similar analysis could be put forward for getting a clue on how we extract meaningful contents out of complex informational input.},

dealing with large systems. However, this difficulty may be overcome by using some controllable
quantum system to study another less controllable or accessible quantum system, i.e., quantum
simulation. Quantum simulation promises to have applications in the study of many problems in, e.g.,
condensed-matter physics, high-energy physics, atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and cosmology.
Quantum simulation could be implemented using quantum computers, but also with simpler, analog
devices that would require less control, and therefore, would be easier to construct. A number of
quantum systems such as neutral atoms, ions, polar molecules, electrons in semiconductors,
superconducting circuits, nuclear spins, and photons have been proposed as quantum simulators.
This review outlines the main theoretical and experimental aspects of quantum simulation and
emphasizes some of the challenges and promises of this fast-growing field.},

Using a quantum computer to simulate such quantum systems has been viewed as a key application of quantum computation from the very beginning of the field in the 1980s. Moreover, useful results beyond the reach of classical computation are expected to be accessible with fewer than a hundred qubits, making quantum simulation potentially one of the earliest practical applications of quantum computers.

Hard probes in the QGP can be treated as open quantum systems governed in the Markovian limit by the Lindblad equation. However, due to large computational costs, most current phenomenological calculations of hard probes evolving in the QGP use semiclassical approximations of the quantum evolution. Quantum computation can mitigate these costs, and offers the potential for a fully quantum treatment with exponential speedup over classical techniques. We report a simplified demonstration of our framework on IBM Q quantum devices, and apply the Random Identity Insertion Method (RIIM) to account for CNOT depolarization noise, in addition to measurement error mitigation.

  abstract      = {With the rapid progress in quantum hardware, there has been an increased interest in new quantum algorithms to describe complex many-body systems searching for the still-elusive goal of 'useful quantum advantage'. Surprisingly, quantum algorithms for the treatment of open quantum systems (OQSs) have remained under-explored, in part due to the inherent challenges of mapping non-unitary evolution into the framework of unitary gates. Evolving an open system unitarily necessitates dilation into a new effective system to incorporate critical environmental degrees of freedom. In this context, we present and validate a new quantum algorithm to treat non-Markovian dynamics in OQSs built on the Ensemble of Lindblad's Trajectories approach, invoking the Sz.-Nagy dilation theorem. Here we demonstrate our algorithm on the Jaynes-Cummings model in the strong coupling and detuned regimes, relevant in quantum optics and driven quantum systems studies. This algorithm, a key step towards generalized modeling of non-Markovian dynamics on a noisy-quantum device, captures a broad class of dynamics and opens up a new direction in OQS problems.},

tasks---generalized time evolution with a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, linear algebra problems, and open
quantum system dynamics. The algorithm for generalized time evolution provides a unified framework for
variational quantum simulation. In particular, we show its application in solving linear systems of equations
and matrix-vector multiplications by converting these algebraic problems into generalized time evolution.
Meanwhile, assuming a tensor product structure of the matrices, we also propose another variational
approach for these two tasks by combining variational real and imaginary time evolution. Finally,
we introduce variational quantum simulation for open system dynamics. We variationally implement the
stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation, which consists of dissipative evolution and stochastic jump processes.
We numerically test the algorithm with a 6-qubit 2D transverse field Ising model under dissipation},

If the Lindbladian consists of $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ operators that can each be expressed as a linear combination of $\mathrm{poly}(n)$ tensor products of Pauli operators then the gate cost of our algorithm is $O(t\, \mathrm{polylog}(t/\epsilon)\mathrm{poly}(n))$. We also obtain similar bounds for the cases where the Lindbladian consists of local operators, and where the Lindbladian consists of sparse operators. This is remarkable in light of evidence that we provide indicating that the above efficiency is impossible to attain by first expressing Lindblad evolution as Schr\"{o}dinger evolution on a larger system and tracing out the ancillary system: the cost of such a \textit{reduction} incurs an efficiency overhead of $O(t^2/\epsilon)$ even before the Hamiltonian evolution simulation begins. Instead, the approach of our algorithm is to use a novel variation of the "linear combinations of unitaries" construction that pertains to channels.},

Great efforts have recently been devoted to its extension to quantum computing for efficiently solving static many-body problems and simulating real and imaginary time dynamics. In this work, we first review the conventional variational principles, including the Rayleigh-Ritz method for solving static problems, and the Dirac and Frenkel variational principle, the McLachlan's variational principle, and the time-dependent variational principle, for simulating real time dynamics. We focus on the simulation of dynamics and discuss the connections of the three variational principles. Previous works mainly focus on the unitary evolution of pure states. In this work, we introduce variational quantum simulation of mixed states under general stochastic evolution. We show how the results can be reduced to the pure state case with a correction term that takes accounts of global phase alignment. For variational simulation of imaginary time evolution, we also extend it to the mixed state scenario and discuss variational Gibbs state preparation. We further elaborate on the design of ansatz that is compatible with post-selection measurement and the implementation of the generalised variational algorithms with quantum circuits. Our work completes the theory of variational quantum simulation of general real and imaginary time evolution and it is applicable to near-term quantum hardware.},

This allows us to define a cost function that consists of the time evolution generator of the quantum master equation. Evaluation of physical observables is, in turn, carried out by a quantum circuit with the original number of qubits.

It is important to ask the following question: Can this simulation be achieved using near-future quantum processors, of modest size and under imperfect control, or must it await the more distant era of large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computing? Here, we propose a variational method involving closely integrated classical and quantum coprocessors. We presume that all operations in the quantum coprocessor are prone to error. The impact of such errors is minimized by boosting them artificially and then extrapolating to the zero-error case. In comparison to a more conventional optimized Trotterization technique, we find that our protocol is efficient and appears to be fundamentally more robust against error accumulation.},

  abstract      = {Imaginary time evolution is a powerful tool for studying quantum systems. While it is possible to simulate with a classical computer, the time and memory requirements generally scale exponentially with the system size. Conversely, quantum computers can efficiently simulate quantum systems, but not non-unitary imaginary time evolution. We propose a variational algorithm for simulating imaginary time evolution on a hybrid quantum computer. We use this algorithm to find the ground-state energy of many-particle systems; specifically molecular hydrogen and lithium hydride, finding the ground state with high probability. Our method can also be applied to general optimisation problems and quantum machine learning. As our algorithm is hybrid, suitable for error mitigation and can exploit shallow quantum circuits, it can be implemented with current quantum computers.},

Based on this, we propose a geometrical way of quantifying quantum discord. For two qubits this results in a closed form of expression for discord. We apply our results to the model of deterministic quantum computation with one qubit, showing that quantum discord is unlikely to be the reason behind its speedup.},

In experiment, quantum supremacy has recently been achieved by the Google team by using a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) device with over 50 qubits. However, the question of what can be implemented on NISQ devices is still not fully explored, and discovering useful tasks for such devices is a topic of considerable interest. Hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are regarded as well-suited for execution on NISQ devices by combining quantum computers with classical computers, and are expected to be the first useful applications for quantum computing. Meanwhile, mitigation of errors on quantum processors is also crucial to obtain reliable results. In this article, we review the basic results for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms and quantum error mitigation techniques. Since quantum computing with NISQ devices is an actively developing field, we expect this review to be a useful basis for future studies.},

An immediate consequence is that dissipative quantum computing is no more powerful than the unitary circuit model. Our result can be seen as a dissipative Church-Turing theorem, since it implies that under natural assumptions, such as weak coupling to an environment, the dynamics of an open quantum system can be simulated efficiently on a quantum computer. Formally, we introduce a Trotter decomposition for Liouvillian dynamics and give explicit error bounds. This constitutes a practical tool for numerical simulations, e.g., using matrix-product operators. We also demonstrate that most quantum states cannot be prepared efficiently.},

Whereas such a statement is true for many forms of dissipation, we show here that dissipation can also have exactly the opposite effect: it can be a fully fledged resource for universal quantum computation without any coherent dynamics needed to complement it. The coupling to the environment drives the system to a steady state where the outcome of the computation is encoded. In a similar vein, we show that dissipation can be used to engineer a large variety of strongly correlated states in steady state, including all stabilizer codes, matrix product states, and their generalization to higher dimensions.},

It is shown that such processes can be embedded in a Markovian dynamics which involves a time dependent Lindblad generator on an extended state space. If the state space of the open system is given by some Hilbert space ${\mathcal{H}}$, the extended state space is the triple Hilbert space ${\mathcal{H}}\otimes{\mathbb C}^3$ which is obtained by combining the open system with a three state system. This embedding is used to derive an unraveling for non-Markovian time evolution by means of a stochastic process in the extended state space. The process is defined through a stochastic Schr{\"o}dinger equation which generates genuine quantum trajectories for the state vector conditioned on a continuous monitoring of an environment. The construction leads to a continuous measurement interpretation for non-Markovian dynamics within the framework of the theory of quantum measurement.},

  abstract      = {The dynamical behavior of open quantum systems plays a key role in many applications of quantum mechanics, examples ranging from fundamental problems, such as the environment-induced decay of quantum coherence and relaxation in many-body systems, to applications in condensed matter theory, quantum transport, quantum chemistry, and quantum information. In close analogy to a classical Markovian stochastic process, the interaction of an open quantum system with a noisy environment is often modeled phenomenologically by means of a dynamical semigroup with a corresponding time-independent generator in Lindblad form, which describes a memoryless dynamics of the open system typically leading to an irreversible loss of characteristic quantum features. However, in many applications open systems exhibit pronounced memory effects and a revival of genuine quantum properties such as quantum coherence, correlations, and entanglement. Here recent theoretical results on the rich non-Markovian quantum dynamics of open systems are discussed, paying particular attention to the rigorous mathematical definition, to the physical interpretation and classification, as well as to the quantification of quantum memory effects. The general theory is illustrated by a series of physical examples. The analysis reveals that memory effects of the open system dynamics reflect characteristic features of the environment which opens a new perspective for applications, namely, to exploit a small open system as a quantum probe signifying nontrivial features of the environment it is interacting with. This Colloquium further explores the various physical sources of non-Markovian quantum dynamics, such as structured environmental spectral densities, nonlocal correlations between environmental degrees of freedom, and correlations in the initial system-environment state, in addition to developing schemes for their local detection. Recent experiments addressing the detection, quantification, and control of non-Markovian quantum dynamics are also briefly discussed.},

The size of the circuits for which these techniques can be applied is limited by the rate at which the errors in the computation are introduced. Near-term applications of early quantum devices, such as quantum simulations, rely on accurate estimates of expectation values to become relevant. Decoherence and gate errors lead to wrong estimates of the expectation values of observables used to evaluate the noisy circuit. The two schemes we discuss are deliberately simple and do not require additional qubit resources, so to be as practically relevant in current experiments as possible. The first method, extrapolation to the zero noise limit, subsequently cancels powers of the noise perturbations by an application of Richardson's deferred approach to the limit. The second method cancels errors by resampling randomized circuits according to a quasiprobability distribution.},

Two quantum error mitigation (QEM) techniques have been introduced recently, namely error extrapolation [Li2017,Temme2017] and quasi-probability decomposition [Temme2017]. To enable practical implementation of these ideas, here we account for the inevitable imperfections in the experimentalist's knowledge of the error model itself. We describe a protocol for systematically measuring the effect of errors so as to design efficient QEM circuits. We find that the effect of localised Markovian errors can be fully eliminated by inserting or replacing some gates with certain single-qubit Clifford gates and measurements. Finally, having introduced an exponential variant of the extrapolation method we contrast the QEM techniques using exact numerical simulation of up to 19 qubits in the context of a `SWAP test' circuit. Our optimised methods dramatically reduce the circuit's output error without increasing the qubit count or time requirements.},

  abstract      = {Quantum error mitigation (QEM) is vital for noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. While most conventional QEM schemes assume discrete gate-based circuits with noise appearing either before or after each gate, the assumptions are inappropriate for describing realistic noise that may have strong gate-dependence and complicated nonlocal effects, and general computing models such as analog quantum simulators. To address these challenges, we first extend the scenario, where each computation process, being either digital or analog, is described by a continuous time evolution. For noise from imperfections of the engineered Hamiltonian or additional noise operators, we show it can be effectively suppressed by a novel stochastic QEM method. Since our method only assumes accurate single qubit controls, it is applicable to all digital quantum computers and various analog simulators. Meanwhile, errors in the mitigation procedure can be suppressed by leveraging the Richardson extrapolation method. As we numerically test our method with various Hamiltonians under energy relaxation and dephasing noise and digital quantum circuits with additional two-qubit crosstalk, we show an improvement of simulation accuracy by two orders. We assess the resource cost of our scheme and conclude the feasibility of accurate quantum computing with NISQ devices.},

To fight the noise in the practical application of near-term quantum computers, instead of relying on quantum error correction which requires large qubit overhead, we turn to quantum error mitigation, in which we make use of extra measurements. Error extrapolation is an error mitigation technique that has been successfully implemented experimentally. Numerical simulation and heuristic arguments have indicated that exponential curves are effective for extrapolation in the large circuit limit with an expected circuit error count around unity. In this Article, we extend this to multi-exponential error extrapolation and provide more rigorous proof for its effectiveness under Pauli noise. This is further validated via our numerical simulations, showing orders of magnitude improvements in the estimation accuracy over single-exponential extrapolation. Moreover, we develop methods to combine error extrapolation with two other error mitigation techniques: quasi-probability and symmetry verification. As shown in our simulation, our combined method can achieve low estimation errors with a sampling cost multiple times smaller than quasi-probability while without needing to be able to adjust the hardware error rate as required in canonical error extrapolation.},

Unfortunately these conditions are challenging to satisfy. Here we present a method by which the proper compensation strategy can instead be learned ab initio. Our training process uses multiple variants of the primary circuit where all non-Clifford gates are substituted with gates that are efficient to simulate classically. The process yields a configuration that is near-optimal versus noise in the real system with its non-Clifford gate set.

  abstract      = {Methods of quantum nuclear wave-function dynamics have become very efficient in simulating large isolated systems using the time-dependent variational principle (TDVP). However, a straightforward extension of the TDVP to the density matrix framework gives rise to methods that do not conserve the energy in the isolated system limit and the total system population for open systems where only energy exchange with the environment is allowed. These problems arise when the system density is in a mixed state and is simulated using an incomplete basis. Thus, the basis set incompleteness, which is inevitable in practical calculations, creates artificial channels for energy and population dissipation. To overcome this unphysical behavior, we have introduced a constrained Lagrangian formulation of TDVP applied to the non-stochastic open system Schrodinger equation (NOSSE) [L. Joubert-Doriol, I. G. Ryabinkin, and A. F. Izmaylov, J. Chem. Phys. 141, 234112 (2014)].

Even this, however, is hardly practicable when one has to deal with very many electrons, so that one then requires a still simpler and rougher method. Such a method is provided by Thomas' atomic model, in which the electrons are regarded as forming a perfect gas satisfying the Fermi statistics and occupying the region of phase space of lowest energy. This region of phase space is assumed to be saturated, with two electrons with opposite spins in each volume (2$\pi$h)3, and the remainder is assumed to be empty. Although this model hitherto has not been justified theoretically, it seems to be a plausible approximation for the interior of a heavy atom and one may expect it to give with some accuracy the distribution of electric charge there.},

In this paper, we study the application of VQE to the simulation of molecular energies using the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz. We introduce new strategies to reduce the circuit depth for the implementation of UCC and improve the optimization of the wavefunction based on efficient classical approximations of the cluster amplitudes. Additionally, we propose an analytical method to compute the energy gradient that reduces the sampling cost for gradient estimation by several orders of magnitude compared to numerical gradients. We illustrate our methodology with numerical simulations for a system of four hydrogen atoms that exhibit strong correlation and show that the circuit depth of VQE using a UCC ansatz can be reduced without introducing significant loss of accuracy in the final wavefunctions and energies.},

For quantum systems, where the dimension of the problem space grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estimation algorithm can efficiently find the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. We present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and we combine this method with a new approach to state preparation based on ans{\"a}tze and classical optimization. We have implemented the algorithm by combining a small-scale photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We experimentally demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chemistry: calculating the ground state molecular energy for He-H+, to within chemical accuracy. The proposed approach, by drastically reducing the coherence time requirements, enhances the potential of the quantum resources available today and in the near future.},

  abstract  = {Understanding dissipation in 2D quantum many-body systems is an open challenge which has proven remarkably difficult. Here we show how numerical simulations for this problem are possible by means of a tensor network algorithm that approximates steady states of 2D quantum lattice dissipative systems in the thermodynamic limit. Our method is based on the intuition that strong dissipation kills quantum entanglement before it gets too large to handle. We test its validity by simulating a dissipative quantum Ising model, relevant for dissipative systems of interacting Rydberg atoms, and benchmark our simulations with a variational algorithm based on product and correlated states. Our results support the existence of a first order transition in this model, with no bistable region. We also simulate a dissipative spin 1/2 XYZ model, showing that there is no re-entrance of the ferromagnetic phase. Our method enables the computation of steady states in 2D quantum lattice systems.},

  abstract  = {After two decades of development, cavity{~}quantum electrodynamics with superconducting circuits has emerged as a rich platform for quantum computation and simulation. Lattices of coplanar waveguide resonators constitute artificial materials for microwave photons, in which interactions between photons can be incorporateded either through the use of nonlinear resonator materials or through coupling between qubits and resonators. Here we make use of the previously overlooked property that these lattice sites are deformable and permit tight-binding lattices that are unattainable even in solid-state systems. We show that networks of coplanar waveguide resonators can create a class of materials that constitute lattices in an effective hyperbolic space with constant negative curvature. We present numerical simulations of hyperbolic analogues of the kagome lattice that show unusual densities of states in which a macroscopic number of degenerate eigenstates comprise a spectrally isolated flat band. We present a proof-of-principle experimental realization of one such lattice. This paper represents a step towards on-chip quantum simulation of materials science and interacting particles in curved space.},

  abstract  = {In most introductory courses on quantum mechanics one is taught that the Hamiltonian operator must be Hermitian in order that the energy levels be real and that the theory be unitary (probability conserving). To express the Hermiticity of a Hamiltonian, one writes H = H {\dag}, where the symbol {\dag} denotes the usual Dirac Hermitian conjugation; that is, transpose and complex conjugate. In the past few years it has been recognized that the requirement of Hermiticity, which is often stated as an axiom of quantum mechanics, may be replaced by the less mathematical and more physical requirement of space -- time reflection symmetry (𝒫𝒯 symmetry) without losing any of the essential physical features of quantum mechanics. Theories defined by non-Hermitian 𝒫𝒯-symmetric Hamiltonians exhibit strange and unexpected properties at the classical as well as at the quantum level. This paper explains how the requirement of Hermiticity can be evaded and discusses the properties of some non-Hermitian 𝒫𝒯-symmetric quantum theories.},

  abstract  = {Exactly solvable models have played an important role in establishing the sophisticated modern understanding of equilibrium many-body physics. Conversely, the relative scarcity of solutions for nonequilibrium models greatly limits our understanding of systems away from thermal equilibrium. We study a family of nonequilibrium models, some of which can be viewed as dissipative analogues of the transverse-field Ising model, in that an effectively classical Hamiltonian is frustrated by dissipative processes that drive the system toward states that do not commute with the Hamiltonian. Surprisingly, a broad and experimentally relevant subset of these models can be solved efficiently. We leverage these solutions to compute the effects of decoherence on a canonical trapped-ion-based quantum computation architecture, and to prove a no-go theorem on steady-state phase transitions in a many-body model that can be realized naturally with Rydberg atoms or trapped ions.},

Here we address this issue for two different physical scenarios: (i) a conformally invariant (2+1)d quantum critical point in the incarnation of the transverse-field Ising model on the square lattice and (ii) spontaneously broken continuous symmetries with gapless Goldstone modes exemplified by the S=1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg and XY models on the square lattice. We find that the energetically best wave functions display finite correlation lengths and we introduce a powerful finite correlation length scaling framework for the analysis of such finite bond dimension (finite-D) iPEPS states. The framework is important (i) to understand the mild limitations of the finite-D iPEPS manifold in representing Lorentz-invariant, gapless many-body quantum states and (ii) to put forward a practical scheme in which the finite correlation length $\xi$(D) combined with field theory inspired formulas can be used to extrapolate the data to infinite correlation length, i.e., to the thermodynamic limit. The finite correlation length scaling framework opens the way for further exploration of quantum matter with an (expected) Lorentz-invariant, massless low-energy description, with many applications ranging from condensed matter to high-energy physics.},

  abstract  = {An accurate calculation of the properties of quantum many-body systems is one of the most important yet intricate challenges of modern physics and computer science. In recent years, the tensor network ansatz has established itself as one of the most promising approaches enabling striking efficiency of simulating static properties of one-dimensional systems and abounding numerical applications in condensed matter theory. In higher dimensions, however, a connection to the field of computational complexity theory has shown that the accurate normalization of the two-dimensional tensor networks called projected entangled pair states (PEPS) is \#P-complete. Therefore an efficient algorithm for PEPS contraction would allow solving exceedingly difficult combinatorial counting problems, which is considered highly unlikely. Due to the importance of understanding two- and three-dimensional systems the question currently remains: Are the known constructions typical of states relevant for quantum many-body systems? In this work, we show that an accurate evaluation of normalization or expectation values of PEPS is as hard to compute for typical instances as for special configurations of highest computational hardness. We discuss the structural property of average-case hardness in relation to the current research on efficient algorithms attempting tensor network contraction, hinting at a wealth of possible further insights into the average-case hardness of important problems in quantum many-body theory.},

The key idea of the formulation is that rather than keep the lowest-lying eigenstates of the Hamiltonian in forming a new effective Hamiltonian of a block of sites, one should keep the most significant eigenstates of the block density matrix, obtained from diagonalizing the Hamiltonian of a larger section of the lattice which includes the block. This approach is much more accurate than the standard approach; for example, energies for the S=1 Heisenberg chain can be obtained to an accuracy of at least 10−9. The method can be applied to almost any one-dimensional quantum lattice system, and can provide a wide variety of static properties., This article appears in the following collection:},

  abstract  = {An algorithm for the simulation of the evolution of slightly entangled quantum states has been recently proposed as a tool to study time-dependent phenomena in one-dimensional quantum systems. Its key feature is a time-evolving block-decimation (TEBD) procedure to identify and dynamically update the relevant, conveniently small, subregion of the otherwise exponentially large Hilbert space. Potential applications of the TEBD algorithm are the simulation of time-dependent Hamiltonians, transport in quantum systems far from equilibrium and dissipative quantum mechanics. In this paper we translate the TEBD algorithm into the language of matrix product states in order to both highlight and exploit its resemblances to the widely used density-matrix renormalization-group (DMRG) algorithms. The TEBD algorithm, being based on updating a matrix product state in time, is very accessible to the DMRG community and it can be enhanced by using well-known DMRG techniques, for instance in the event of good quantum numbers. More importantly, we show how it can be simply incorporated into existing DMRG implementations to produce a remarkably effective and versatile ‘adaptive time-dependent DMRG’ variant, that we also test and compare to previous proposals.},

The calculations unveil that ground state entanglement in extended quantum systems is organized in layers corresponding to different length scales.

We describe an algorithm to approximate the ground state of a local Hamiltonian on a L×L lattice with the topology of a torus. Accurate results are obtained for L=\{4,6,8\}, whereas approximate results are obtained for larger lattices. As an application of the approach, we analyze the scaling of the ground-state entanglement entropy at the quantum critical point of the model. We confirm the presence of a positive additive constant to the area law for half a torus. We also find a logarithmic additive correction to the entropic area law for a square block. The single copy entanglement for half a torus reveals similar corrections to the area law with a further term proportional to 1/L.},

Although the momentum-space and quantum-chemistry versions of the density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method have long been applied to such systems, the spatial topology of DMRG-based methods allows efficient optimizations to be carried out with respect to one spatial dimension only. Extending the matrix-product-state picture, we formulate a more general approach by allowing the local sites to be coupled to more than two neighboring auxiliary subspaces. Following [Y. Shi, L. Duan, and G. Vidal, Phys. Rev. A 74, 022320 (2006)], we treat a treelike network ansatz with arbitrary coordination number z, where the z=2 case corresponds to the one-dimensional (1D) scheme. For this ansatz, the long-range correlation deviates from the mean-field value polynomially with distance, in contrast to the matrix-product ansatz, which deviates exponentially. The computational cost of the tree-tensor-network method is significantly smaller than that of previous DMRG-based attempts, which renormalize several blocks into a single block. In addition, we investigate the effect of unitary transformations on the local basis states and present a method for optimizing such transformations. For the 1D interacting spinless fermion model, the optimized transformation interpolates smoothly between real space and momentum space. Calculations carried out on small quantum chemical systems support our approach.},

Instead of requiring an accurate representation of the system evolution until the stationary state is attained, the algorithm directly targets the final state, thus, allowing for a faster convergence when the steady state is a MPO with small bond dimension. Our numerical simulations for several dissipative spin models over a wide range of parameters illustrate the performance of the method and show that, indeed, the stationary state is often well described by a MPO of very moderate dimensions.},

  abstract  = {We develop a numerical procedure to efficiently model the nonequilibrium steady state of one-dimensional arrays of open quantum systems based on a matrix-product operator ansatz for the density matrix. The procedure searches for the null eigenvalue of the Liouvillian superoperator by sweeping along the system while carrying out a partial diagonalization of the single-site stationary problem. It bears full analogy to the density-matrix renormalization-group approach to the ground state of isolated systems, and its numerical complexity scales as a power law with the bond dimension. The method brings considerable advantage when compared to the integration of the time-dependent problem via Trotter decomposition, as it can address arbitrarily long-ranged couplings. Additionally, it ensures numerical stability in the case of weakly dissipative systems thanks to a slow tuning of the dissipation rates along the sweeps. We have tested the method on a driven-dissipative spin chain, under various assumptions for the Hamiltonian, drive, and dissipation parameters, and compared the results to those obtained both by Trotter dynamics and Monte Carlo wave function methods. Accurate and numerically stable convergence was always achieved when applying the method to systems with a gapped Liouvillian and a nondegenerate steady state.},

This book is intended for use as a text for upper division and gradu­ ate courses.

A possible subtitle of this book could be Matrix Inequalities. A reader who works through the book should expect to become proficient in the art of deriving such inequalities. Other authors have compared this art to that of cutting diamonds. One first has to acquire hard tools and then learn how to use them delicately.

Spatial fluctuations destroy long-range limit-cycle ordering for dimension d≤2, as a time-dependent generalization of the Mermin-Wagner theorem. This result can be interpreted in terms of a spatiotemporal Goldstone mode corresponding to phase fluctuations of the limit cycle. We also demonstrate that the limit-cycle phase exhibits an asymmetric power spectrum measurable in fluorescence experiments.},

We also identify collective bistable phases, where the system supports two steady states among spatially uniform, antiferromagnetic, and limit cycle phases. We compare these mean-field results to exact quantum trajectory simulations for finite one-dimensional arrays. The exact results exhibit short-range antiferromagnetic order for parameters that have significant overlap with the mean-field phase diagram. In the mean-field bistable regime, the exact quantum dynamics exhibits real-time collective switching between macroscopically distinguishable states. We present a clear physical picture for this dynamics and establish a simple relationship between the switching times and properties of the quantum Liouvillian.},

We introduce an efficient scheme accounting for the corrections to mean field by correlations at leading order, and benchmark this scheme using high-precision numerics based on matrix-product operators in one- and two-dimensional lattices. Correlations are shown to wash the mean-field bistability in dimension one, leading to a unique steady state. In dimension two and higher, we find that multistability is again possible, provided the thermodynamic limit of an infinitely large lattice is taken first with respect to the longtime limit. Variation of the system parameters results in jumps between the different steady states, each showing a critical slowing down in the convergence of perturbations towards the steady state. Experiments with trapped ions can realize the model and possibly answer open questions in the nonequilibrium many-body dynamics of these quantum systems, beyond the system sizes accessible to present numerics.},

  abstract  = {Quantum-mechanical effects at the macroscopic level were first explored in Josephson-junction-based superconducting circuits in the 1980s. In recent decades, the emergence of quantum information science has intensified research toward using these circuits as qubits in quantum information processors. The realization that superconducting qubits can be made to strongly and controllably interact with microwave photons, the quantized electromagnetic fields stored in superconducting circuits, led to the creation of the field of circuit quantum electrodynamics (QED), the topic of this review. While atomic cavity QED inspired many of the early developments of circuit QED, the latter has now become an independent and thriving field of research in its own right. Circuit QED allows the study and control of light-matter interaction at the quantum level in unprecedented detail. It also plays an essential role in all current approaches to gate-based digital quantum information processing with superconducting circuits. In addition, circuit QED provides a framework for the study of hybrid quantum systems, such as quantum dots, magnons, Rydberg atoms, surface acoustic waves, and mechanical systems interacting with microwave photons. Here the coherent coupling of superconducting qubits to microwave photons in high-quality oscillators focusing on the physics of the Jaynes-Cummings model, its dispersive limit, and the different regimes of light-matter interaction in this system are reviewed. Also discussed is coupling of superconducting circuits to their environment, which is necessary for coherent control and measurements in circuit QED, but which also invariably leads to decoherence. Dispersive qubit readout, a central ingredient in almost all circuit QED experiments, is also described. Following an introduction to these fundamental concepts that are at the heart of circuit QED, important use cases of these ideas in quantum information processing and in quantum optics are discussed. Circuit QED realizes a broad set of concepts that open up new possibilities for the study of quantum physics at the macro scale with superconducting circuits and applications to quantum information science in the widest sense.},

In recent years, cavity experiments have also been conducted on a variety of solid-state systems resulting in many interesting applications, of which microlasers, photon bandgap structures and quantum dot structures in cavities are outstanding examples. Although these phenomena and systems are very interesting, discussion is limited here to free atoms and mostly single atoms because these systems exhibit clean quantum phenomena and are not disturbed by a variety of other effects. At the centre of our review is the work on the one-atom maser, but we also give a survey of the entire field, using free atoms in order to show the large variety of problems dealt with. The cavity interaction can be separated into two main regimes: the weak coupling in cavity or cavity-like structures with low quality factors Q and the strong coupling when high-Q cavities are involved. The weak coupling leads to modification of spontaneous transitions and level shifts, whereas the strong coupling enables one to observe a periodic exchange of photons between atoms and the radiation field. In this case, atoms and photons are entangled, this being the basis for a variety of phenomena observed, some of them leading to interesting applications in quantum information processing. The cavity experiments with free atoms reached a new domain with the advent of experiments in the visible spectral region. A review on recent achievements in this area is also given.},

The eigenwert problem involved in the corresponding computation for a long strip crystal of finite width (n atoms), joined straight to itself around a cylinder, is solved by direct product decomposition; in the special case n=∞ an integral replaces a sum. The choice of different interaction energies (±J,±J′) in the (0 1) and (1 0) directions does not complicate the problem. The two-way infinite crystal has an order-disorder transition at a temperature T=Tc given by the condition sinh(2JkTc) sinh(2J′kTc)=1. The energy is a continuous function of T; but the specific heat becomes infinite as −log {\textbar}T−Tc{\textbar}. For strips of finite width, the maximum of the specific heat increases linearly with log n. The order-converting dual transformation invented by Kramers and Wannier effects a simple automorphism of the basis of the quaternion algebra which is natural to the problem in hand. In addition to the thermodynamic properties of the massive crystal, the free energy of a (0 1) boundary between areas of opposite order is computed; on this basis the mean ordered length of a strip crystal is (exp (2JkT) tanh(2J′kT))n.},

  abstract  = {The study of open quantum systems – microscopic systems exhibiting quantum coherence that are coupled to their environment – has become increasingly important in the past years, as the ability to control quantum coherence on a single particle level has been developed in a wide variety of physical systems. In quantum optics, the study of open systems goes well beyond understanding the breakdown of quantum coherence. There, the coupling to the environment is sufficiently well understood that it can be manipulated to drive the system into desired quantum states, or to project the system onto known states via feedback in quantum measurements. Many mathematical frameworks have been developed to describe such systems, which for atomic, molecular, and optical (AMO) systems generally provide a very accurate description of the open quantum system on a microscopic level. In recent years, AMO systems including cold atomic and molecular gases and trapped ions have been applied heavily to the study of many-body physics, and it has become important to extend previous understanding of open system dynamics in single- and few-body systems to this many-body context. A key formalism that has already proven very useful in this context is the quantum trajectories technique. This method was developed in quantum optics as a numerical tool for studying dynamics in open quantum systems, and falls within a broader framework of continuous measurement theory as a way to understand the dynamics of large classes of open quantum systems. In this article, we review the progress that has been made in studying open many-body systems in the AMO context, focussing on the application of ideas from quantum optics, and on the implementation and applications of quantum trajectories methods in these systems. Control over dissipative processes promises many further tools to prepare interesting and important states in strongly interacting systems, including the realisation of parameter regimes in quantum simulators that are inaccessible via current techniques.},

We show here that this phenomenon is not restricted to thermal equilibrium, rather it survives more generally in a dissipative highly nonequilibrium system driven into a steady state. By considering a quantum fluid of polaritons of an experimentally relevant size, in the so-called optical parametric oscillator regime, we demonstrate that it indeed undergoes a phase transition associated with a vortex binding-unbinding mechanism. Yet, the exponent of the power-law decay of the first-order correlation function in the (algebraically) ordered phase can exceed the equilibrium upper limit: this shows that the ordered phase of driven-dissipative systems can sustain a higher level of collective excitations before the order is destroyed by topological defects. Our work suggests that the macroscopic coherence phenomena, observed recently in interacting two-dimensional light-matter systems, result from a nonequilibrium phase transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless rather than the Bose-Einstein condensation type.},

This method gives tractable simulations of many-body systems because the number of variables scales linearly with the spatial lattice size. An expression for the useful simulation time is obtained, and checked in numerical simulations. The dynamics of first-, second- and third-order spatial correlations are calculated for a uniform interacting 1D Bose gas subjected to a change in scattering length. Propagation of correlations is seen. A comparison is made with other recent methods. The positive P method is particularly well suited to open systems as no conservation laws are hard-wired into the calculation. It also differs from most other recent approaches in that there is no truncation of any kind.},

  abstract      = {Photonic materials are a rapidly growing platform for studying condensed matter physics with light. The exquisite capability of state preparation and detection, as well as the engineering of lattice geometries, is allowing us to learn about the relation between microscopic dynamics and macroscopic properties. Here we study Bose-Einstein condensation of exciton-polaritons into a lowest Landau level of a strained honeycomb lattice of semiconductor micropillars. The strain induces a pseudomagnetic field which has opposite sign in each Dirac valley. With a suitably designed sublattice-asymmetry of the incoherent pump, we find that the condensate spontaneously breaks the valley symmetry and polaritons accumulate in the lowest Landau level of a given valley. For growing condensate sizes, the interplay of the pseudomagnetic field and the quantisation of circulation in the condensate leads to the formation of a vortex array in analogy with an ultracold atomic superfluid in a rapidly rotating trap. We explain how this peculiar non-equilibrium stationary state -- which takes place in the middle of the energy spectrum -- results from a dynamical balance of incoherent pump and losses and is stabilised by the sublattice polarisation of the lowest Landau level. Our results offer a new platform where to study the exciting physics of arrays of quantised vortices and pave the way to explore the transition from a vortex-dominated phase to the fractional quantum Hall regime.},

  abstract  = {Many-body systems with both coherent dynamics and dissipation constitute a rich class of models which are nevertheless much less explored than their dissipationless counterparts. The advent of numerous experimental platforms that simulate such dynamics poses an immediate challenge to systematically understand and classify these models. In particular, nontrivial many-body states emerge as steady states under nonequilibrium dynamics. While these states and their phase transitions have been studied extensively with mean-field theory, the validity of the mean-field approximation has not been systematically investigated. In this paper, we employ a field-theoretic approach based on the Keldysh formalism to study nonequilibrium phases and phase transitions in a variety of models. In all cases, a complete description via the Keldysh formalism indicates a partial or complete failure of the mean-field analysis. Furthermore, we find that an effective temperature emerges as a result of dissipation, and the universal behavior including the dynamics near the steady state is generically described by a thermodynamic universality class.},

Here we specialize to the case of Abelian groups and, for concreteness, to a U(1) symmetry, associated, e.g., with particle number conservation. We consider tensor networks made of tensors that are invariant (or covariant) under the symmetry, and explain how to decompose and manipulate such tensors in order to exploit their symmetry. In numerical calculations, the use of U(1)-symmetric tensors allows selection of a specific number of particles, ensures the exact preservation of particle number, and significantly reduces computational costs. We illustrate all these points in the context of the multiscale entanglement renormalization Ansatz.},
